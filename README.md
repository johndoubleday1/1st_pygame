# 1st_pygame

I am very happy to share my first pygame!

I spent the last few days following the tutorials from techwithtim which i highly recommend and this is the product of that!
Moving forward I am excited to use alot of the tools learned in something original. 

As always any tips or improvements are welcomed, Thanks for checking it out!
